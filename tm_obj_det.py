# This program uses Tensorflow and OpenCV to detect objects in the video
# captured from your webcam. This program is meant to be used with machine
# learning models generated with Teachable Machine.
#
# Teachable Machine is a great machine learning model trainer and generator
# created by Google. You can use Teachable Machine to create models to detect
# objects in images, sounds in audio, or poses in images. For more info, go to:
# https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/
#
# For this project, you will be generating a image object detection model. Go
# to the website, click "Get Started" then go to "Image Project". Follow the
# steps to create a model. Export the model as a "Tensorflow->Keras" model.
#
# To run this code in your environment, you will need to:
#   * Install Python 3 & library dependencies
#       * Follow instructions for your setup
#   * Export your teachable machine tensorflow keras model and unzip it.
#       * You need both the .h5 file and labels.txt
#   * Update model_path to point to location of your keras model
#   * Update labels_path to point to location of your labels.txt
#   * Adjust width and height of your webcam for your system
#       * Adjust frameWidth with your video feed width in pixels
#       * Adjust frameHeight with your video feed height in pixels
#   * Set your confidence threshold
#       * conf_threshold by default is 90
#   * If video does not show up properly, use the matplotlib implementation
#       * Uncomment "import matplotlib...."
#       * Comment out "cv2.imshow" and "cv2.waitKey" lines
#       * Uncomment plt lines of code below
#   * Run "python3 tm_obj_det.py"
